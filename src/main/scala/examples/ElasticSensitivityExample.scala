/** A simple differential privacy example using elastic sensitivity.
  *
  * This example code supports queries that return a single column and single row. The code can be extended to support
  * queries returning multiple columns and rows by generating independent noise samples for each cell based the
  * appropriate column sensitivity.
  *
  * Caveats:
  *
  * Histogram queries (using SQL's GROUP BY) must be handled carefully so as not to leak information in the bin labels.
  * The analysis throws an error to warn about this, but t his behavior can overridden if you know what you're doing.
 * *
  * This example does not implement a privacy budget management strategy. Each query is executed using the full budget
  * value of EPSILON. Correct use of differential privacy requires allocating a fixed privacy from which a portion is
  * depleted to run each query. A privacy budget strategy depends on the problem domain and threat model and is
  * therefore beyond the scope of this tool.
